# DemoRepParse

A quick Java implementation of the Shunting Yard algorithm as described by Theodore Norvell in [Parsing Expressions by Recursive Descent](https://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm).

This is a test to help me write it in C++ to be used by [NumRepper](https://github.com/whimax07/NumRepper). Note that it accepts numbers with "0x" and "0b" prefixes and can be easily expanded to include bitwise operations.
